## head


The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.

Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.

Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.

The following elements can go inside the <head> element:

- `<title>` (required in every HTML document)
- `<style>`
- `<base>`
- `<link>`
- `<meta>`
- `<script>`
- `<noscript>`

> The <link> tag is used to link to external resource
  
eg:
```
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```
  
The <link> tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.

The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets or to add a favicon to your website.
